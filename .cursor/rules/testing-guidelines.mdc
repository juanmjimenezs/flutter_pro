# Flutter Testing Guidelines

## General Testing Principles
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests
- Name test variables clearly following the convention:
  - inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.

## Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for each public function
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies
  - Exception: third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute

## Acceptance Testing
- Write acceptance tests for each module
- Follow the Given-When-Then convention

## Flutter-specific Testing
- Use the standard widget testing for Flutter
- Use integration tests for each API module
